Hello there!
If you know, I am a student at Amity International School, Vasundhara Sector 6, Ghaziabad. Historically, there had been no clubs (like music, tech, etc.). Seeing this and at that time I was also passionate about tech and its possible opportunities, I took the initiative to make a tech club. My thought process was that school clubs were a popular idea, especially in the Western world, and also Amity's own school (Noida branch) had a really popular tech club (shoutout to Tech Syndicate; https://techsyndicate.us/). Seeing this, I took the initiative and made this club. But, I hadn't done my due diligence to actually see the demand of tech club in our school. Turns out, only a handful of people knew about languages other than HTML (Very basic HTML was taught to us in earlier classes) and out of those, only 1-2 people had even **_heard_** of Github. Hence, this died before it even started.     
**Thus, this group will not be used and is hence archived, unless there is a sudden demand for it (which is highly unlikely).**
